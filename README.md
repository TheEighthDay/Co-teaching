## Introduction

pass

## Data for UDA and UDE

First, we need download [Office-Home](https://www.hemanthdv.org/officeHomeDataset.html) and [DomainNet](http://ai.bu.edu/M3SDA/) into `datasets` folder.
Our data division follows the [KDDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00233). We can download division and pretrained checkpoints in this [link](xxxx).
